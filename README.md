## Introduction

Hey 👋, I know you are using github for a while. Have you felt it's so difficult to contact github contributors?. 

💢It's had to find email or other social media links to chat with them . So no more trouble finding contacts.

Its Octopuz time ........🦑

## Solution

Octochatz 🦑 : It is social media, chat ...  multi funtional application. That makes your developer lyf easy . 🐥 

## Choice made

Social media is now popular like stars , there are infinity of them. So we don't want our users to make new account and create profile etc... We provide you everything you have from github itself. The app runs on github-api 😁.
